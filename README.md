Futuristic To-Do List
The Futuristic To-Do List is a simple yet powerful task management application built using Vue.js. It features a clean and intuitive interface designed to help users stay organized and productive. The project begins with a welcome screen that introduces the app, displaying two motivational texts: "Futuristic Todo List" and "Start Smart." A central button, labeled "Create To-Do List," prompts the user to begin their task list journey.

Once the user clicks the button, a new to-do list is generated with the title "Untitle." From there, users can:

Add tasks to their list.
Edit the list dynamically by adding or removing tasks.
Easily delete tasks as they are completed or no longer needed.
The UI is built with simplicity in mind, ensuring that managing tasks is effortless and enjoyable.
